## About ChangeWindows

ChangeWindows has been around for as long as the Windows Insider Program has been around and ever since that faitful day on 1 October 2014, our goal has been the same: do what Microsoft doesn't do: document every change we can possibly find in Windows on any platform.

## Open source

This repository is a big shift for ChangeWindows from the previous 4 major versions. Not only is this the first time we're publishing the actual source of our website, we're also using for the first time a framework, in this case Laravel, to build our website. Not only because we're lazy, but also because it makes things a lot simpeler and cleaner.

ChangeWindows 5.0 is still in development when you're reading this. Chances are that you'll find this to be more of a Laravel-repository than anything else. Before we put this major revamp of our website online, we want to have reached feature parity with what we currently have, and that will take a while. We have to catch up with over 2,5 year of development.
